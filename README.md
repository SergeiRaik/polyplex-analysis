# Spectroscopy & Polyplex Data Analysis

This repository contains examples of data analysis from experimental pharmaceutical research involving nanomaterials and gene delivery systems. The focus is on processing, visualizing, and interpreting spectroscopic and imaging data.

## Contents

### `dls/`   
[DLS analysis notebook](https://github.com/SergeiRaik/polyplex-analysis/blob/main/dls/dls_analysis.ipynb)   
Analysis of polymerâ€“DNA nanocomplexes (polyplexes) using:

- **DLS (Dynamic Light Scattering)**: particle size distribution analysis
- **Electrophoretic Light Scattering**: zeta-potential analysis

Includes data preprocessing, cleaning, and visualization of particles properties changing with different particle compositions.

### `spt/` (Single Particle Tracking)
- Mean Square Displacement (MSD) analysis of particle trajectories
- Estimation of diffusion parameters
- Trajectory visualization

### `uv-spectroscopy/`
- analysis of DNA binding efficiency
- analysis of stability of polyplexes in presence of polyanions or vitreous


## Tools Used

- Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy)
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Git for version control
